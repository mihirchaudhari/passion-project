				<h2>For Me, Coding is a Medium</h2>

				<p>Some people say that coding is the closest thing
				we have to a superpower, and I believe that. Coding
				turns one's imagination into something that other
				people can experience. Although learning a coding
				language may be considered a skill, coding itself
				is not a skill. Coding shows how we think and
				solve problems. This is one of the other reasons
				why I love coding, I get to solve problems and
				express my imagination. I found that I can code
				anytime I want and I always enjoy doing it,
				when you have this feeling about something, that
				is how you know that it's your passion. </p>

				<h2>What can Code do?</h2>
				<p><img src="Images/worldwide-network.jpg" width=550 height=244</p>
				<p>Asking what code can do today is a question asked
				without much thought. In this generation(21st century),
				we have now adapted ourselves to this technology much
				more advanced than the previous generations can handle.
				You could say that code has taken over the world, and
				we do need it a lot. Not only for the applications
				in our devices, but also to the appliances we use.
				How do microwaves know how many seconds to warm something,
				how do printers know if to do a print, a scan, or a fax?
				We rely on code now a lot, but we also rely a lot on
				other subjects, because whatever your passion may be,
				it is important. We need people who can serve us food
				at fast food restaruants and people who can cut our
				hair. Your passion may seem random, but as long as
				you know it's your passion, follow it!</p>
